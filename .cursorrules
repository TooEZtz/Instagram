# Instagram Clone - Code Organization Rules

## CRITICAL: File Organization Rules

### Frontend Files
- **HTML files** MUST be placed in `Frontend/html/` folder
  - Examples: index.html, login.html, profile.html, etc.
  - NEVER place HTML files in root, css/, js/, or any other folder

- **CSS files** MUST be placed in `Frontend/css/` folder
  - Examples: style.css, main.css, components.css, etc.
  - NEVER place CSS files in root, html/, js/, or any other folder

- **JavaScript files** MUST be placed in `Frontend/js/` folder
  - Examples: app.js, auth.js, api.js, etc.
  - NEVER place JavaScript files in root, html/, css/, or any other folder

### Assets Files
- **Images** (photos, pictures, graphics) MUST be placed in `assets/images/` folder
  - User profile pictures, post images, story images, etc.
  - NEVER place images in root, icons/, or any other folder

- **Icons** MUST be placed in `assets/icons/` folder
  - Application icons, UI icons, favicons, etc.
  - NEVER place icons in root, images/, or any other folder

### Backend Files
- **Python backend files** should be in the project root
  - Examples: app.py, config.py, database.py, init_database.py
  - Keep backend files organized by purpose (one purpose per file)

- **SQL files** should be in the project root
  - Examples: schema.sql, migrations, etc.

### General Code Organization Principles

1. **Neat and Clean Code**
   - Write clean, readable, and well-commented code
   - Follow consistent naming conventions
   - Use proper indentation and formatting

2. **One Purpose Per File**
   - Each file should have a single, clear purpose
   - Avoid mixing concerns in a single file
   - Split large files into smaller, focused modules

3. **Files Must Be in Designated Folders**
   - ALWAYS place files in their correct designated folders
   - NEVER mix file types in wrong directories
   - If unsure where a file belongs, ask or check this rules file

4. **Strict Folder Adherence**
   - When creating new files, ALWAYS verify the correct folder location
   - When editing files, ensure they remain in their correct folders
   - When suggesting file creation, ALWAYS specify the correct folder path

## Examples of CORRECT File Placement

✅ `Frontend/html/index.html` - HTML file in html folder
✅ `Frontend/css/style.css` - CSS file in css folder
✅ `Frontend/js/app.js` - JavaScript file in js folder
✅ `assets/images/profile.jpg` - Image in images folder
✅ `assets/icons/logo.png` - Icon in icons folder
✅ `app.py` - Python backend file in root
✅ `schema.sql` - SQL file in root

## Examples of INCORRECT File Placement

❌ `index.html` in root - Should be in `Frontend/html/`
❌ `style.css` in `Frontend/html/` - Should be in `Frontend/css/`
❌ `app.js` in root - Should be in `Frontend/js/`
❌ `photo.jpg` in root - Should be in `assets/images/`
❌ `icon.png` in `assets/images/` - Should be in `assets/icons/`

## When Creating or Suggesting Files

- ALWAYS specify the full correct path including the folder
- ALWAYS verify the file type matches the folder purpose
- ALWAYS follow the folder structure rules above
- If creating multiple files, ensure each goes to its correct folder

## Reminder

These rules are MANDATORY. All code must follow this organization structure. Keep the project neat, clean, and well-organized.
